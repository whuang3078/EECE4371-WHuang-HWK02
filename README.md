### TA response
Hi Wilson! Nice work! (23 points - 2 for late policy = 21 points) Couple of minor comments: 
Could you please next time 
a) create a Pull request to the master branch from the develop branch, which will contain all the changes that you made to the provided codebase?
b) inset screenshots directly into the Readme.md? 
c) Indicate in Readme.md that you completed task for extra points?
Thank you!

Maria, TA
